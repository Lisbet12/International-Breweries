## Recommendations and Findings 
Findings and Recommendations
#### Profit and Cost Trends

- Finding: Both the sum of profit and the sum of cost have reduced every year.
- Recommendation:
Investigate underlying reasons for declining costs and profits, such as changes in production efficiency, market conditions, or pricing strategies.
Reassess cost-control measures to ensure they do not negatively impact revenue generation.
Yearly Profit Comparison

- Finding: Profit in 2017 differs significantly from profits in 2018 and 2019.
- Recommendation:
Analyze external factors (e.g., economic shifts, competition) and internal factors (e.g., operational changes) contributing to this disparity.
Develop strategies to stabilize and increase yearly profits.

#### Top Sales Representatives

- Finding: The sales rep Jones generated the highest profit, followed by Jardine.

Provide targeted training to sales reps to replicate Jones' and Jardine's successful strategies across the team.

#### Most Profitable Brand and Market
